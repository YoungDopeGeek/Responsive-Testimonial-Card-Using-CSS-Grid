                I was an EMT for many years before I joined
                the bootcamp. i've been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun!
                I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
                was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                Since completing the course, i've succesfully switched
                carrers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup

                Before joining the bootcamp, i've never
                written a line of code.I needed some structure
                from professionals who can help me learn programming
                step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
                of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                The entire curriculum and staff did not disapoint.
                they were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. the agile team project, in particular, was outstanding
                It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                in fact,i've often referred to it during interviews as an example
                of my development experience.It certainly helped me land a job
                as a full-stacked developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
